        <p id="tribute-info">
          Odysseus, known as Ulysses in Latin, was the legendary king of Ithaca in Greek mythology.
          Husband of Penelope and father of Telemachus, he is celebrated for his intelligence,
          eloquence, and cunning strategies. Often called “the man of many twists and turns,”
          Odysseus is one of the most fascinating heroes of the ancient world.

          <li>
            <strong>Trojan War:</strong> Odysseus played a crucial role among the Greek leaders.
            He is most famous for conceiving the idea of the Trojan Horse, the stratagem that led to the fall of Troy.

            <strong>The journey home (The <em>Odyssey</em>):</strong> After the war, his return to Ithaca lasted ten long years.
            He blinded the Cyclops Polyphemus, resisted the Sirens, and escaped Scylla and Charybdis. He was also held
            captive by Circe and later by Calypso.

        <p>
          Odysseus remains one of the most enduring figures of classical literature. He symbolizes curiosity,
          resilience, and the quest for knowledge, but also the human struggle between destiny and free will.
          Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, which tells his story, is considered a cornerstone of Western culture and has
          inspired countless works of literature, art, and philosophy throughout history.
